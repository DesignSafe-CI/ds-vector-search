These simulations were used as atmospheric forcing to the hydrodynamic ADCIRC model to assess the storm surge impacts along the New Jersey and New York coastlines. The data presented can be used for additional assessment of tropical cyclone impacts (i.e. precipitation, winds) and sensitivity studies on the effect of atmospheric forcing on storm surge.
